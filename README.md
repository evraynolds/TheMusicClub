Please use the template for all your pages, otherwise Rodrigo & Niral will be unhappy! :(

The template is to keep all the pages to the same standard

**Update Wed 11 Mar 2015 11:28am**

The default colours are:

    dark-background: #151515  // apply for text as well
    avocado:         #83e115  // menu and block
    white:           #ffffff  // background and text

    - Feel free to remove the left block and utilize a full page
    simply remove the div.left-block and change the div.main-content with

    <div class="main-content-full"></div>

    - List a like paragraphs
    you can improve readability from left-block <p>
    all you have to do is include .list to the container containing <p> of course it must be
    inside left-block

please do use these values in your custom stylesheets (if you have one).
