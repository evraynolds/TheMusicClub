Please use the template for all your pages, otherwise Rodrigo & Niral will be unhappy! :(

The template is to keep all the pages to the same standard

**Update Wed 11 Mar 2015 11:28am**

The default colours are:

    dark-background: #151515  // apply for text as well

    avocado:         #83e115  // menu and block
    
    white:           #ffffff  // background and text

please do use these values in your custom stylesheets (if you have one).
