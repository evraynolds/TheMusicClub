				<h2 id="interests"> Interests </h2>

					<p>
						I like to take electronic devices apart, inspect how they operate and then put them back together again. I find that it is a good way to relieve stress.
							<br>
						I have developed a recent interest in photography and am keen to discover exciting places to take pictures as well as photographing situations such as computer builds or upgrades and taking high-resolution pictures of components.
							<br>
						Along with some friends from university, I have developed a website to better inform our peers, through the use of posts, about software engineering. We use the site to write articles about new things we have learned or thing that interest us to pursue them further. The site is called <a class="standout" href="http://learnsofteng.com" target="_new">learnsofteng.com</a>.
					</p>

				<h2 id="achievements"> Additional Achievements </h2>

					<p>
						I have been involved with the Duke of Edinburgh award, I enjoyed it as I worked in a group with friends; we all had attributes and skills to offer and were very supportive of each other
							<br>
						In school there was a couple of occasions where they would ask for volunteers to go to local supermarkets and help bag items for customers. It was a friendly environment and the people were always kind and polite.
