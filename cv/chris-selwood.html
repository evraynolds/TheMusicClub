				<p> 
					I'm currently studying Software Engineering and have a passion for entering the development field. I'm an author and moderator on a new start-up site learnsofteng.com, aiming to provide technically correct, and useful, articles on all areas of development. I'm in the pre-production stages of planning a mobile application, including utilising Objective-C for iOS development, and have an aim to trade independently and start full-time development in April of this year. I'm also in the process of training for an MTA Certification for Software Development Fundamentals and hope to move onto the MCSD course within the near future. I would love any opportunities to intern on development teams!

							September 2014 - Present 
								<br>
							I maintain the stock levels of the department, and helped to facilitate a more efficient stock management system. I help to maintain the waste levels through "shrinkage" management and constant communication with the departmental team. I handle stocking of the shelves, including aesthetic displays, and have helped with the merchandising analysis for the management team, making sure the products are correctly shelved and aesthetically correct. I also maintain hygiene levels across the entire kitchen, including the ovens and food-handling equipment, and organisation of back-store areas.

							Produce/Fresh 
						</p>
					
						<p>
							October 2013 - August 2014 
								<br>
							I maintain the stock levels of the two departments through several different methods, including waste management, shrinkage management and various scanning methods to pursue potential lines which might cause loss. Also, I handle and maintain the "Fruit and Vegetables" department as well as the "Fresh Chilled Foods" department on the shop floor focusing on keeping high levels of stock maintained. This also included the supervision of the warehouse "chiller" rooms.

						<p> 
							January 2013 - October 2013 
								<br>
							I implemented and analysed any planned changes to layouts, to maximise revenue and aesthetic appeal to customers. I had systematic control of all products in the "Dry Goods" department (including food, home equipment, frozen food and electronic items) in order to maintain stock levels and maximise sales output. I regularly liaised with head office, management and senior staff daily, to ensure store presentation and layout reflects the current sales pattern. Also, I had control of the administration of virtual products and the computer system in order to maximise efficiency on the physical displays and keep an organised system; this negates any possibility of incorrect stock and the incorrect delivery of items.

						<p>
							November 2011 - December 2012
								<br>
							I handled and and worked all sub-departments on the general "Dry Goods" department, with a particular focus on the "Frozen" department, maintaining stock levels, aesthetic presentation and the warehouse chiller. I focused heavily on efficiency as the warehouse was -23 degrees.

						<p class="subheading">	
							Customer Service Assistant 
						</p>
						
						<p> 
							November 2010 - November 2011
								<br> 
							I had direct contact with customers on a daily basis, solving issues, completing business transactions and most importantly providing customer service to thousands of people a week. Part of my job was to maintain the quality of the customer service areas and the checkout that is assigned daily. I also had regular responsibilities collecting the "Shopping Trollies" to maintain enough for regular customer use.
